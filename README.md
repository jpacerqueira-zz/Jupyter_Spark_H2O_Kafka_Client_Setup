# Project lost_saturn 

   An setup with Jupyter Spark AutoML h2o.ai and client libraries Delta.io, PyArrow and Kafka
   Ideal to use Jupyter and tools exploring data in environments
   Docker (Ubunto 18 LTS) or Windows10 WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux)

   Setup Options
=========

   Option 1
===
     Run using Docker Desktop in your Laptop

       ./install-container.sh



   Option 2
=== 
   Run with Docker the container registred in [repo datascience-fullstack](https://hub.docker.com/r/jpacerqueira83/datascience-fullstack-vm1)
        

     Consume and run docker container with iptable port opening process

        ~ mac-u$ docker run  -it -p 9003:9003 -p 54321:54321 --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name lost_saturn  jpacerqueira83/datascience-fullstack-vm1:latest

        
     Run Docker exec to start Jupyter after setup above finishes

        ~ mac-u$ docker exec -it  lost_saturn  /bin/bash -c "cd ; bash -x library_tools/install-jupyter-support-packs.sh ; sleep 1 ; exit"
        ~ mac-u$ docker exec -it  lost_saturn  /bin/bash -c "cd ; bash -x start-jupyter.sh ; sleep 4 ; cat notebooks/jupyter.log ; sleep infinity"



   Option 2
===
   Run setup in Windows 10 with WSL app Ubunto 18.4 LTS 


     Consume package 

        ~ wsl-u$  cd ; git clone https://github.com/jpacerqueira/Jupyter_Spark_H2O_Kafka_Client_Setup.git


     Execute installation
        ~ wsl-u$  cd ; cp Jupyter_Spark_H2O_Kafka_Client_Setup/library_tools/*.sh . ; bash -x anaconda_setup.sh


   Issues and Workarrounds 
=========

     It is recommended to use JAVA8(Oracle) or OpenJDK8 and not OpenJDK11
        Installation : https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/install-any-oracle-java-jdk-version-in.html
        This installation resolve my issue here : https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/issues/248    
    
     Mount Additional driver in Docker Containers
         Your local container may require to mount large files like Oracle JAVA installer
