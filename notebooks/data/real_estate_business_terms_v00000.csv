,
,Active contingent
,"When a seller accepts an offer from a buyer, that offer is contingent upon the buyer’s ability to meet certain conditions before finalization of the sale. Contingencies might include the buyer selling their home, receiving mortgage approval, or reaching an agreement with the seller on the home inspection."
,
,Active under contract
,"A house is listed as “active under contract” when the seller has accepted an offer with contingencies, but still wants the house to be listed as active. In this situation, the seller is also likely accepting backup offers in case their current offer fails to meet its contingencies."
,
,Addendum
,"If a buyer or seller want to change an existing contract, they might add an addendum outlining the specific part of the contract they’d like to adjust and the parameters of that change. The rest of the contract stays the same, regardless of the addendum."
,
,Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)
,"The interest rate for an adjustable-rate mortgage changes periodically. You might start with lower monthly payments than you would with a fixed-rate mortgage, but fluctuating interest rates will likely make those monthly payments rise in the future."
,
,Adjustment date
,This is the date your mortgage begins to accrue interest (though you might not have made a mortgage payment yet). The adjustment date usually falls on the first day of the month after mortgage funds are advanced or dispersed to the borrower.
,
,Amortization
,"Amortization is the schedule of your mortgage payments spread out over time. In real estate, a buyer's amortization schedule is usually one monthly payment scheduled over a 15- or 30-year period of time."
,
,Annual percentage rate (APR)

If the home’s appraised value is below what the buyer has offered, the lender may request the buyer pay the difference in cost."
,
,Appreciation
,"Appreciation is the amount a home increases in value over time. To calculate a home’s likely appreciation rate, add one to the annual appreciation rate, raise this to a power equal to the number of years you’d like to estimate, then multiply that by the current value of the property."
,
,Assessed value
,An assessment is used to determine how much in taxes the owner of a property will pay. An assessor calculates the assessment of a home’s value by looking at comparable homes in your area and reviewing an inspection of the home in question.

,
,Assumable mortgage

It’s usually associated with investment or construction projects that are issued for the short term and don’t require collateral."
,
,Bi-weekly mortgage
,"A bi-weekly mortgage payment means a homeowner pays their monthly mortgage payment in two monthly installments instead of one.

,Buydown
,"A buydown is a mortgage-financing technique lowering the buyer’s interest rate for anywhere from a few years to the lifetime of the loan. Usually, the property seller or contractor makes payments to the mortgage lender lowering the buyer’s monthly interest rates, which, in turn, lowers their monthly payments."

,
,Cash-out refinance

,
,Clear title
,"Also known as a ""just title,"" ""good title,"" or a ""free and clear title"" -- a clear titledoesn’t have any kind of lien or levy from creditors. It means there's no question of legal ownership of the property such as building code violations or bad surveys."

,
,Co-borrower
,"If a buyer is having trouble getting approved for a loan, they can elicit the help of a co-borrower. This person is usually a family member or friend who's added to the mortgage and guarantees the loan. They're listed on the title, have ownership interest, sign loan documents, and are obligated to pay monthly mortgage payments if the buyer is unable to."
,
,Commission
,Real estate commission is generally 5-6% of the home’s sale price. That commission is usually split between the buyer’s and seller’s agents and is paid by the seller at the time of closing.

,A construction loan -- or self-build loan -- is a short-term loan used to finance the construction of a home or real estate project. This type of loan covers project costs before long-term funding can be financed.
,
,Contingency
,"If a property is contingent, or the contract contains a contingency, certain events must transpire or the contract can be considered null. A contingency might be that the home must past an appraisal or receive a clean inspection."
,
,"The sale of a home could also be contingent on the buyer selling their home by a specified date. If either the buyer or seller fail to meet the expectations of the contingency, either party can exit the contract."
,
,Contingent vs. pending
,"When a property is contingent, it means the owner has accepted an offer -- but certain contractual expectations must be met or the offer will be void. If all contingencies are met, the property changes status to “pending.” While contingent offers are still considered active listings, pending offers are taken off the market and other offers will not be entertained."
,
,Conventional mortgage
,"A conventional mortgage is a loan not guaranteed or insured by the federal government. These borrowers usually make larger down payments (at least 20%), don’t require mortgage insurance, and are at a lower risk of defaulting on their home loan payment."
,
,Convertible ARM
,"A convertible adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) allows buyers to take advantage of low interest rates by receiving a loan at a “teaser” loan interest rate.Their monthly mortgage payment stays the same, but interest rates fluctuate (usually every six months). The borrower has the option of converting their ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, but there are generally fees for the switch."
,
,
,Cost of funds index (COFI)
,A cost of funds index is an average of the regional interest expenses acquired by financial institutions. It’s used to calculate variable rate loans.
,

,
,Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure
,"A deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is a document transferring the title of a property from a homeowner to the bank that holds the mortgage. A homeowner might submit a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure if the bank has denied them a loan modification or short sale. However, the bank can deny the request for a deed-in-lieu (and often do)."
,
,Default
,"If a homeowner defaults on their loan, it means they have not paid the sum they agreed to. Typically, a mortgage default means the homeowner hasn’t made a home loan payment in 90 days or more."

,
,Equity
,"Home equity is the part of your property you actually own. While you do “own” your home, your mortgage lender has interest in the property until it’s paid off.

Home equity will increase as you pay down your loan or the market value of your home increases."
,
,
,Escrow
,"Escrow is part of the homebuying process. It happens when a third party holds something of value during the transaction.

,
,Examination of title
,"A title examination reviews all public records tied to a property. It generally reviews all previous deeds, wills, and trusts to ensure the title has passed cleanly and legally to every new owner."
,
,Exclusive listing

,
,Fee simple
,"Fee simple refers to the most common type of property ownership. It means the owner’s rights to the property are indefinite and can be freely transferred or inherited when the owner chooses. It is most often associated with single-family homes, as condominiums and townhomes are purchased with covenants, conditions, and restrictions."
,
,FHA mortgage
,"Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans have been around since 1934 and are meant to help first-time homebuyers. The FHA insures the loan, making it easier for lenders to offer the homebuyer a better deal, including a lower down payment (as low as 3.5% of the purchase price), low closing costs, and easier credit qualifying."
,
,Fixed-rate mortgage
,"A fixed-rate mortgage is one of the most common types of loans. It comes with an interest rate that stays the same for the lifetime of the loan, and provides the borrower with more stability and predictability over the lifetime of their loan. While mortgage payments can fluctuate as property taxes and homeowner’s insurance change, many consumers prefer the fixed-rate mortgage for its long-term reliability."
,
,For sale by owner
,Homes listed as for sales by owner (FSBO) are being sold without the help of a real estate agent. The biggest benefit to the seller is they avoid paying commission fees -- but there are few benefits to the buyer.
,
,Foreclosure
,"If a homeowner doesn’t make a mortgage payment (usually, for more than 90 days), foreclosure is a legal process during which the owner forfeits all property rights.

,
,Home inspection
,"A home inspection is carried out by an objective third party to establish the condition of a property during a real estate transaction. An inspector will report on such things as a home’s heating system, the stability of the foundation, and the condition of the roof. The inspection is meant to identify major issues that might affect the value of the home and the stability of your and your lender’s investment and return."
,
,Homeowner’s association
,"A homeowner’s association (HOA) is usually found when you purchase a condominium, townhome, or other development property. To purchase the home, you must also join the HOA and pay monthly or yearly HOA fees. These fees can cover common area maintenance, repairs, and general upkeep. The more amenities your building offers, the higher the HOA fees typically are."
,
,Homeowner’s insurance
,"When you purchase a home, it's also necessary to purchase homeowner’s insurance to cover any losses or damages you might incur, such as natural disaster, theft, or damage. It also protects the homeowner from liability against any accidents in the home or on the property. Insurance payments are usually included in your monthly mortgage payments."
,
,Judicial foreclosure
,Judicial foreclosures are mandatory in some but not all states. They require all foreclosures go through the court system to confirm the debt is in default before putting the property up for auction. The goal of judicial foreclosures is to protect property owners from corrupt lenders.
,
,Jumbo loan
,"Conforming loan limits cap the dollar value that can be backed by government-sponsored programs. A jumbo mortgage exceeds these conforming loan limits, which are tied to local median home values. Qualifications for these loans are more stringent and the loans themselves are manually underwritten to mitigate risk to the lender."
,
,Lease option
,"A lease option is like rent-to-own for real estate. It gives the lessee the ability to lease property with the option to buy. It includes a legal agreement with a monthly rental amount due, while also including an option to buy the property for a predetermined price at any time during the length of the agreement."
,

,
,Life cap
,A life cap refers to the maximum amount an interest rate on an adjustable rate loan can increase over the lifetime of the loan. A life cap is also known as an absolute interest rate or interest rate ceiling and keeps interest rates from ballooning too high over the term of the loan.

,
,Loan-to-value
,
,"The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is the mortgage loan balance divided by the home’s value. It shows how much you’re borrowing from a lender as a percentage of your home’s appraised value. The higher your LTV, the riskier you’ll appear during the loan underwriting process because a low down payment denotes less equity or ownership in your property making you more likely to default on your loan."
,
,Lock-in period
,The period of time in which a borrower cannot repay their loan in full without incurring a penalty fine by the lender.
,
,Mortgage
,A mortgage is the agreement between a borrower and a lender giving the lender the right to the borrower’s property if the borrower is unable to make loan payments (with interest) within an agreed upon timeline.

,
,Mortgage insurance
,"If a homebuyer makes a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price of a home or is the recipient of an FHA or USDA loan, they’ll usually be required to pay mortgage insurance. It lowers the risk of a lender giving you a loan, but it also increases the cost of the loan."
,
,Multiple Listing Service (MLS)
,"An MLS is a suite of around 700 regional databases containing their own listings. Each database has its own listings, requires agents to pay dues for access, and allows agents to share listings across regions -- without paying dues to each one. It is widely considered the most comprehensive listing service available."
,
,Negative amortization
,"Amortization refers to the process of paying off a loan with regular payments so the amount you owe on the loan gradually decreases. Negative amortization happens when the amount you owe continues to rise, regardless of regular payments, because you’re not paying enough to cover the interest."
,
,No cash-out refinance
,"A no cash-out refinance is a type of loan used to improve the rate the borrower pays on the loan. It might also shorten the lifetime of a loan to benefit the borrower. In a no cash-out refinance, the borrower refinances an existing mortgage for equal to or less than the outstanding loan balance. The goal is to lower interest rates on the loan or change certain terms of the mortgage."
,
,No-cost mortgage
,A no-cost mortgage is a type of refinancing in which the lender pays the borrower’s loan settlement costs and extends a new loan -- usually in exchange for the borrower paying higher interest rates. The mortgage lender then sells the mortgage to a secondary mortgage market for a higher price because of the high interest rate.
,

,
,Pending

,
,Principal
,"The principal of a loan is the amount of money owed on that loan. As you make monthly mortgage payments, your principal -- in theory -- goes down. The amount of interest you pay on a monthly loan will affect how much of your monthly mortgage payment goes to paying down the principal. A high interest rate means you’ll pay less on the principal, meaning you’ll pay more on your loan over time."
,
,Purchase agreement
,A purchase agreement demonstrates a buyer’s intent to purchase a piece of property and a seller’s intent to sell that property. The document outlines the terms and conditions of a sale and holds each party legally accountable to meeting their agreement.
,

,
,Quitclaim deed
,"A quitclaim deed is a document transferring ownership of property from one party to another. It transfers the title of the property -- but only transfers what the seller actually owns.

,"If a third party buyer offers to buy or lease a property owner's asset, the right of first refusal ensures the property holder is allowed a chance to buy or lease the asset under the same terms offered by the third party before the property owner accepts the third-party offer."
,
,Right of ingress or egress
