# Using Kalman Filter to Predict COVID19 Spread

This work  presents the implementation of an online real-time Kalman filter algorithm to predict the spread of COVID19 per given region.
Coronavirus(COVID19 or SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused major worldwide concern.
As the number of coronavirus cases reportedly increases, the spread of COVID19 is a serious threat to global health. 
In this work, we will try to predict the spread of coronavirus for each one of the infected regions. 
Fitting time series analysis and statistical algorithms to produce the best short term and long term prediction. 
An adaptive online Kalman filter provides us very good one-day predictions for each region.
